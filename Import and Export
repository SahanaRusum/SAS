Import and export
import and export they both are used to move data in and out of SAS from external files like Excel, CSV, or text files. 
Here we use proc import and proc export method. 
For importing:
For csv file:
proc import datafile="C:\yourpath\file.csv" ("Path of the file to be included")
     out=mydata
     dbms=csv
     replace;
     getnames=yes;
run;
For excel file: Xlsx extension is used and we can also specify what sheet we need to import. 
proc import datafile="C:\yourpath\file.xlsx"
     out=mydata
     dbms=xlsx
     replace;
     sheet="Sheet1";
     getnames=yes;
run;
datafile = path to our input file
out =  name of the SAS dataset to create
dbms = file type (csv, xlsx, etc.)
replace = overwrite the dataset if it already exists
getnames= yes (to use the first row as variable names, by defualt it is yes)
For exporting: 
CSV file:
proc export data=mydata
     outfile="C:\yourpath\output.csv"
     dbms=csv
     replace;
run;
Excel file:
proc export data=mydata
     outfile="C:\yourpath\output.xlsx"
     dbms=xlsx
     replace;
     sheet="ExportedSheet";
run;
data =  the SAS dataset that we're exporting.
outfile = file path and name to save it as. Such as here the name of my file whether it's csv or excel it is output
dbms =  type of file to export to.
sheet = for Excel, name of the worksheet.
