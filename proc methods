These are common proc methods. 

Proc print: Print a dataset.
proc print data=sashelp.class;
run;

Proc contents: Show dataset structure.
proc contents data=sashelp.class;
run;

proc means: Get statistics like mean, min, max,n, range, and  all.
proc means data=sashelp.class;
   var height weight;
run;
Calculates stats - height  and weight variabes from the class dataset.

proc freq: Generates frequency tables â€” it counts how often each value occurs in a variable.
Used in categorical data analysis (like gender, region, grade levels, etc.).

proc freq data=sashelp.class;
   tables sex;
run;
This will count how many students are male and female in the class dataset. 

proc sort: Sorts data by variable(s).
proc sort data=sashelp.class out=sorted;
   by age;
run;
Sorts students by age in ascending order.

proc sort data=sashelp.class out=sorted;
   by  descending age;
run;
Sorts students by age in descending order.

proc transpose: Flip data layout.
proc transpose data=sashelp.class out=transposed;
   by name;
   var height weight;
run;
Turns height and weight into rows for each given name in the dataset. 

proc format: To assign user-defined labels to values of variables. Works on numeric or character variables. Helps in making reports cleaner and more understandable.
proc format;
   value $genderfmt
      'M' = 'Male'
      'F' = 'Female';
run;
proc print data=sashelp.class;
   format sex $genderfmt.;
   var name sex;
